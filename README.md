# fastHttpFilesharer
Small console program to share individual files or directories over http(Port 80) in your local network

I used this project to get a small insight into `golang`. So there are probably better solutions for this out there in the web...

## Usage
If no arguments are passed, the program will share the directory it is started from (must not be the directory it is saved in)
Arguments have to be non relative paths to directories or files.

Exit with <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd> or by closing the terminal.
